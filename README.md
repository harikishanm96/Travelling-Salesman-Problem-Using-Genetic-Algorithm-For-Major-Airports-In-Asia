# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-Using-Genetic-Algorithm-For-Major-Airports-In-Asia
Travelling Salesman Problem - “Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?”

In this project, I have used genetic algorithm to find the shortest route for major airports in Asia.
